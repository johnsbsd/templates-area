### USR_SIZE in GB necessary space for md0 device used to build iso
# and it depends of built flavour, ARCH and for actual pkglist is about:
# 4.5 for xfce i386 and      for xfce amd64
# 5.4 for mate i386 and    for mate amd64
#   gnome i386 and       for gnome amd64
#   cinnamon i386 and      for cinnamon amd64
#USR_SIZE=5.6
BACKEND_SIZE=10
PORTS_SIZE=3

# Memory device back-end can be (mem or file).
# "mem" will speed the build process. But you need an machine with
# at least ($USR_SIZE + 2) GB ram
# "file" it's the safest way but at lowest speed

# If calculated IP of first jail is > 254 add a value below
